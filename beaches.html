        Sri Lanka is a tropical island nestled in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.  The country has thousands of kilometers of beautiful golden beaches bordered by coconut trees, making it an ideal beach holiday destination. A large number of high-end resorts and villas, as well as budget hotels, along the shore, offering visitors some of Sri Lanka's greatest beach holidays. The beaches, of course, are the major attraction for visitors and locals, but other areas, such as Galle on the south coast, holds a historical value, which is a big plus to a sun and sand holiday. It is worth taking a trip around the south and west beaches. <br> <br>
        Here are some of the most attractive beaches in sri lanka, <br> <br>
        <h4>Nilaveli beach</h4> <br>

        The magnificent beach in Trincomalee City contains sandy coastlines and crystal blue seas. There are lots of activities that will entertain you while at the beach, aside from lying around. The moon gleaming over the land or open area is referred to as "Nilaveli" in Tamil. If you wish to unwind on your Sri Lanka holiday with your family, this is a perfect spot to stay. <br> <br>

        Nilaveli Beach is also notable for its nearby beach resort and coastal town. Nearby places like Uppuveli are also popular tourist attractions.  Since the Tsunami that occurred in 2005, the number of tourists has reduced slightly but after many years now it is back to normal. Although the popularity of this among Sri Lankans, however, has not changed. <br> <br>Also  1 km from Nilaveli is the Pigeon island national park, which is one of the surrounding attractions worth seeing. The quantity of coral reefs adds to the beauty of the scene. <br> <br>

        <h4>Arugam Bay</h4> <br> <br>
        <div class="photos">
          <img src="https://totalsurfcamp.com/sites/default/files/surfcamps/%5Btitle-raw%5D/arugam-bay-sri-lanka.jpg" alt="arugam-bay-sri-lanka">
        </div> <br> <br>
        Arugam Bay, commonly known as the "surfer's paradise," is a lesser-known beauty on Sri Lanka's east coast. It is not well-known among travelers due to being away from the city area. As a consequence, it has managed to maintain its small-town charm while gaining in popularity among visitors interested in seeing some of Sri Lanka's most unique sites.  <br> <br>
        Because Sri Lanka is a tropical nation, the weather in Arugam Bay is usually decent, except during the monsoon season. The months of May through September, after the monsoons have passed, are ideal for visiting this location. <br> <br>
