        Sri Lanka’s cultural depth is recognized by UNESCO, which has declared six archaeological World Heritage Sites in the country, <br> <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The sacred city of Anuradhapura</li>
          <li>The golden temple of Dambulla</li>
          <li>The ancient city of Polonnaruwa</li>
          <li>The sacred city of Kandy</li>
          <li>The ancient city of Sigiriya</li>
          <li>The old town of Galle and its fortifications</li>
        </ul> <br> 
        The monumental dagobas (dome-shaped structures) and the remains of ancient buildings within the ruined cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, as well as the amazing staircase to the temple at Dambulla and the sensual wall paintings of beautiful maidens at the palace on the rock of Sigiriya, will provide visitors with an unforgettable experience of these World Heritage Sites.  <br> <br>
