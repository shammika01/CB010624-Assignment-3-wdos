        The story behind the creation of this kingdom is tragic. There were two princes Mogallana and Kashyapa, Mogallana had been the heir to the throne, but his brother Kashyapa had seized control by force. By killing their father, the king.

        King Kashyapa was concerned that his brother might return to claim the kingdom for himself.

        Being afraid of Mogallana seeking revenge, Kashyapa constructed this castle to defend himself. <br> <br>

        The Lion Rock is believed to be built in the place of Sigiri, the ancient city of Sri Lanka. During the period of King Kasyapa of the Hero Age, it was the place where he built his palace and laid the foundations of a cultural centre that was to become a great civilization. In the 5th century AD, the king built Sigiriya as a palace and a cultural centre. The Sigiriya rock was used as a building material for this palace. The rock was carved on all sides to provide a stairway with carvings depicting scenes from the ancient world. The Sigiriya rock carvings provide a rare glimpse into the ancient world of Sri Lanka.

        The Sigiriya city was built on a massive rock and the surrounding plain was cultivated. This construction was done by cutting out the rock to create a large artificial platform on which the palace and other buildings were built. The architectural style of the buildings and the sculptures indicate that the site was developed by the people of the 4th or 5th century AD. Most of the structures have been damaged due to the natural weathering process and also by the human destructive activities and only scattered pieces remain.
